# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide provides a quick overview of our processes to help new contributors and team members quickly understand how we manage projects.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Our processes cover the full project lifecycle from initiation to retrospective.

## Process Documentation

Our project management framework consists of the following key areas:

- **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** - Core principles, roles, artifacts, and communication cadence
- **[Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** - Problem definition, stakeholder identification, and initial timeline
- **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** - Scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies
- **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** - Build, test, review, and iteration processes
- **[Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** - Deployment verification and release announcements
- **[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** - Learning capture and action items
- **[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** - Risk identification, tracking, and escalation paths
- **[Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** - Detailed role definitions and responsibilities

## Key Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Named Project Manager and Product Lead for each project
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and continuous learning
